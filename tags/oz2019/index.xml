      <description>Alison Hill (I think her unofficial nickname is RMarkdown Whisperer) is going to talk to us on another of her strengths. Making things beautiful, and informative. She&amp;rsquo;s going to do her &amp;ldquo;Take a Sad Plot &amp;amp; Make it Better&amp;rdquo; talk, for us. In this talk, Alison will discuss one plot’s life cycle, from a sad Powerpoint slide to the finished product made with the ggplot2 package in R, and what she learnt from it.</description>

      <title>Plot Twist: 10 Bake Offs, Visualized 11 Ways</title>

      <description>Using data from 10 series of The Great British Bake Off, we will walk through eleven ways to visualize the same data using the ggplot2 package. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk a lot about geoms and variable mappings, but also about what it means to &amp;ldquo;tidy your data&amp;rdquo;, plus the new pivot functions in the tidyr package.
You won&amp;rsquo;t need your laptops but you will get the most out of this talk if you know some basics about using ggplot2.</description>

      <title>The Art of Literate Projecting</title>

      <description>“Literate programming” is an approach to writing software programs that weaves together the source code and documentation at the time of creation. The idea is to create programs that are easier for users to understand. But they are also easier for programmers to work on and maintain. In this talk, I will describe how data scientists can be inspired by this programming approach and start what I refer to as “literate projecting.</description>

      <description>In this talk, Alison will talk about one plot’s life cycle, from a sad Powerpoint slide to an Excel chart and finally to the finished product made with the ggplot2 package in R. Along the way, she will discuss why each version of the plot fails in different ways and how each iteration improved on the last one.
Latest event    This talk was most recently given at the University of South Wales on 2019/10/04.</description>

      <title>Teaching Students to Talk about Data Science</title>

      <description>Data science educators have a unique opportunity to teach students the skills they need in their future careers. We know that practical skills matter, like being able to wrangle, explore, analyze, and visualize data (preferably using code), but what is easy to overlook is teaching students how to communicate about data science with other people. Being able to communicate about data, code, and insights gained are important skills we can strengthen in the classroom to make a real impact on students.</description>
