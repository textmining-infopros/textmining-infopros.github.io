      <description>I am originally from Atlanta, Georgia, and am a proud ramblin&#39; wreck from Georgia Tech. I received my PhD in psychology and quantitative methods from Vanderbilt University in 2008. Prior to joining RStudio, I was an Assistant Professor at Arizona State University, and an Associate Professor at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University (OHSU). At OHSU, I was an NIH-funded Principal Investigator and an Assistant Center Director.
My research focused on health-related applications of Natural Language Processing-based methods, and was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, and Autism Speaks.</description>
